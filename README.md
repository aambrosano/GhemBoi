GhemBoi (GameBoy ROM disassembler)
==================================

I was just wondering how to disassemble a GameBoy ROM, and it came out this code.
There's no particular needing to explain the use of this code at the moment, since
there is just a couple of classes in it.
Feel free to do whathever you want with this code, if you ever, unlikely, need it.
